# Linear-Regression-to-Predict-House-Prices
## In this project, a linear regression model was trained to predict the sale price of a house. First, all necessary libraries were imported. Next the data was imported from a CSV file and briefly explored using various Pandas functions and graphs utilizg both Seaborn and Matplotlib. From there, the data was cleaned and prepared for further analysis. The data was analyzed to determine the relationship between the variables and the price of the house using  Using Pearson correlation coefficients, the top 30 numerical independent variables/features were gathered. From here 12 models were trained on the best 5, 10, 15, 25 and 30 independent variables.  Half were given SalePrice as the dependent variable and the other half the log of SalePrice. Scikitlearns linear regression model was utilized to produce said models. R<sup>2</sup> and predicted SalePrice were both used to find the best performing linear regression models. The two best models were then used to predict house sale prices on a set of unseen test data. Again R<sup>2</sup> values and predicted SalesPrice were both used to evaluate the performance of the models.
